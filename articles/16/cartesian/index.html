      <h1>Subsets and cartesian products</h1>
<p>September 15, 2016</p>


<p><span class="newthought">Computing subsets and Cartesian products</span>  are common <br />
tasks you are faced with when trying to solve problems by computer <br />
programming. And common advice you get is to do these things by <br />
recursion or, in the case of Cartesian products, by Lisp macros.<br />
But we don’t want to do them that way.</p>

<h4 id="subsets">1. Subsets</h4>

<p>A typical Scheme formula for computing subsets uses recursion. But<br />
suppose you are looking for something among the subsets of a large<br />
set. What if you have billions of subsets and you want to iterate over<br />
them one at a time? Well forget the usual recursive solutions. We are<br />
going to use bit-hacking on integers.</p>

<p>Every subset of a set can be represented by a binary code. For <br />
example consider the set <code>{A,B,C,D,E}</code>. If we set <code>0</code> to<br />
mean “don’t choose the element” and <code>1</code> to mean “choose the<br />
element”, then the subset <code>{A,C,E}</code> can be represented<br />
by the binary code <code>10101</code>:</p>

<pre><code>A B C D E
1`0 1 0 1
---------
A   C   E
</code></pre>

<p>This leads to a good idea! If we take any integer less than <code>2^5</code><br />
and we extract the bits using arithmetic right shift, we can decode<br />
which elements are chosen for the subset and which are rejected.<br />
Looping through all such numbers gives us all possible subsets.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cl">(defun subsets (myset)
  (loop for k from 0 below (expt 2 (length myset))
     collecting (loop for s in myset
		   with subset = nil
		   with bitfield = k
		   do (when (= 1 (logand bitfield 1))
			(push s subset))
		     (setf bitfield (ash bitfield -1))
		   finally (return subset))))
</code></pre>

<p>We test if the last bit is 1 by doing bitwise-<code>and</code> with 1. Then we <br />
right-shift to get the next bit, and so on. We know that there will <br />
be <code>2^n</code> subsets, so we know when to stop. This way of doing it <br />
allows some easy modifications. For instance, if you don’t want the <br />
empty set, just start iterating from <code>k=1</code> instead of <code>k=0.</code> What <br />
could possibly be easier than this? No need for mind-bending <br />
inefficient recursion. Illustration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cl">&gt; (subsets '(a b c d))
(NIL (A) (B) (B A) (C) (C A) (C B) (C B A) (D) (D A) 
(D B) (D B A) (D C) (D C A) (D C B) (D C B A))
</code></pre>

<h4 id="cartesian-products">2. Cartesian Products</h4>

<p>Suppose we have three lists of number <code>(2 3 5)</code>, <code>(7 11 13)</code> <br />
and <code>(17 19 23).</code> We want to form all possible products obtained by <br />
choosing one number from each list. No problem, you say, you’ll just <br />
use nested loops, one loop for each list. But that works only if you <br />
know you will have exactly three lists of numbers. What if you have <br />
<code>n</code> lists of numbers? Then what? Recursion? I’ve seen it done that <br />
way. Macros? Yes, incredible as it sounds, I’ve seen macros that <br />
generate <code>n</code> nested loops to do this job.</p>

<p>But none of such things are necessary when there exists a perfectly <br />
good functional programming idiom tailor-made for these kind of <br />
jobs: <code>reduce</code>!</p>

<pre><code class="language-cl">(defun cartesian (list-of-lists)
  (reduce #'(lambda (u v)
	      (loop for i in u 
                 nconc (loop for j in v collect (* i j))))
	  list-of-lists))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>lambda</code> function takes two lists and does a Cartesian product,<br />
concatenating all the results into one big list. Further Cartesian <br />
products are accumulated into this list by <code>reduce</code> as it traverses <br />
down the <code>list-of-lists.</code> There, a simple functional way <br />
of doing it. Illustration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cl">&gt;(cartesian '((2 3 5) (7 11 13) (17 19 23)))
(238 266 322 374 418 506 442 494 598 357 399 483 561 627 
 759 663 741 897 595 665 805 935 1045 1265 1105 1235 1495)
</code></pre>

<p>A example of an application for Cartesian product is to compute <br />
all the divisors of a number when the prime factorization is known.</p>
